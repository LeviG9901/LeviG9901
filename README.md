- 👋 Hello!
- 👉 My name is Levente Gvárdián.
- 🎂 I'm 23 years old.
- 🏙️ I live in Hungary, Tatabánya.
- 👨‍🎓 Graduated in february 2022 from Széchenyi István University.
- 👨‍💻 My major is Computer Science Engineer (BSc).
- 🕵️ I’m currently looking for (IT Software Developer) jobs in Hungary. (remote/hybrid)
- 💼 Unfortunately, I have no working experience.
- 📚 Some Programming languages I've came across during my studies:<br />
     | Python | Java | PHP | C++ | Javascript | HTML/CSS | SQL |<br />
- 📄 About my thesis: (can be found on github as DrowsinessDetection)<br />

     My thesis is about Detecting and monitoring the driver's eyes (open/closed),
     mouth (yawn), and upper body (moving) trough camera. The program gives an
     alert sound, when the driver's eyes are closed for a given time (approximately 3-5 seconds).
     The whole detection, and monitoring is logged and the logs are saved into MySQL Database.
     When there is no alert happening, the saved log content from the database is deleted every
     30 seconds, and only saved permanently if an alert happened.
  - Contained:
    - Deep learning
    - Convolutional Neural Network <br />
      |-> Keras model-> I created it for eye open or close state detection<br />
      |-> PoseNet model-> Used pretrained model for upperbody keypoints detection<br />
      |-> DLib model-> Used pretrained shape prediction model for yawn detection<br />
  - Programming languages:
    - Python
    - SQL
  - Some of the most important Python libs:
    - dlib
    - keras
    - matplotlib
    - numpy
    - opencv-python
    - scipy
    - tensorflow
- 💪 My strengths:
  - Precise
  - Hard working
  - Working in team or working by myself
  - Enthusiastic, and motivated
